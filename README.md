# Software Engineering Research on the Robot Operating System: A Systematic Literature Review

This repository contains the replication package of the systematic literature review on software engineering research on the Robot Operating System (ROS). 
The contents of this repository can be used to:

- Replicate the steps to obtain the potentially relevant studies (1634).
- Replicate the steps to filter the potentially relevent studies to the selected studies (35).
- Replicate the snowballing steps with each iteration.
- Produce the plots presented in the paper.

This study has been designed, performed, and reported by the following researchers:

- Milica Dordevic (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)
- Engel Hamer (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)

### Overview of the replication package
---

This replication package is structured as follows:

- The scripts used for automating certain steps in the search and selection process are located in the `scripts` folder.
- The Jupyter notebooks used for producing all figures in the paper are located in the `data_analysis` folder.
