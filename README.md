# Software Engineering Research on the Robot Operating System: A Systematic Literature Review

This repository contains the replication package of the systematic literature review on software engineering research on the Robot Operating System (ROS). 
The contents of this repository can be used to:

- Replicate the steps to obtain the potentially relevant studies (224).
- Replicate the steps to filter the potentially relevent studies to the selected studies (25).
- Produce the plots presented in the paper.
- Further searches on DBLP snapshots.

This study has been designed, performed, and reported by the following researchers:

- Milica Dordevic (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam - The Netherlands)
- Engel Hamer (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam - The Netherlands)
- Michel Albonico (Federal University of Technology, Paran√° - Brazil)

### Overview of the replication package
---

This replication package is structured as follows:

```
./scripts         The scripts used for automating the search process.
./data_analysis   The Jupyter notebooks used for producing all figures in the paper,
./data_extraction The spreadsheets used in the data extraction stage.
```
